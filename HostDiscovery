NMAP host discovery options are utilized to actively discover the online status of target systems. 

The most optimal approach for recognizing hosts involves the utilization of ICMP echo requests, a method that we will explore in depth.

Documentation of every single scan is always highly recommended, which can later be used to compare, document and report.

#Scan Network Range:
sudo nmap <ip_address with CIDR> -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

<ip_address>	Target network range.
-sn           Disables port scanning.
-oA host	    Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'host'.
Note: This scan will only work if the firewall of the host allow it.

#Scan IP List:
nmap -sn -oA host -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

-iL	 Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list.

#Scan Multiple IPs
nmap -sn -oA host <ip1>,<ip2>,<ip3>,.... | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
OR
nmap -sn -oA tnet <ip1-n> | grep for | cut -d" " -f5
